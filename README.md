# math-check

This is a formal verifier of mathematical theorems. The verifier was written in Rust.

The language and the verifier were designed before I became more familiar with other formal verification software.
Consider this a hobby project that is of less quality than LEAN, metamath, or HOL light.
The language supports ZFC but is very elementary. There is no intrinsic support for equality, although you can define equality yourself.

See documentation.md for documentation and explanation of the language.
